React Editable Data Table

This project is a React component that provides a data table with editable rows and the ability to add or delete rows dynamically. It utilizes the react-data-table-component library for rendering the table and manages the state of the data through React's useState hook.

npm install react-data-table-component

Features
Add Row: Click the "Add Row" button to dynamically add a new row to the data table.

Delete Row: Each row has a "Delete Row" button that allows you to remove the corresponding row.

Edit Data: You can edit the data in each row by typing directly into the input fields for Name, Age, and Location.
